Version 2.0.22 10-1-2020
- Security fix: Temporary report files may have been generated in the publicly-accessible wp-content directory (or another directory specified by WP_TEMP_DIR) and/or temporary directories that could be accessible by other web server users. The location would have been determined by the get_temp_dir() function in WordPress. In most cases these temporary files would have been deleted quickly but in some cases, such as when using the Scheduled Email Reports addon plugin or when automatic deletion failed, these temporary files may not have been deleted automatically by the plugins in question. This update changes the plugin's temporary directory to a fixed location below wp-content and uses randomized subdirectories to help prevent unauthorized access on a properly configured web server (an update to Scheduled Email Reports also addresses the deletion issue). Existing temporary report files may remain present on the server after update.
