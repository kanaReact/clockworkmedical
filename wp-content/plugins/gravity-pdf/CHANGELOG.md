This major release is designed specifically for Gravity Forms 2.5+ and includes breaking pages that may affect you. You are strongly encouraged to [review the upgrade guide before attempting to update to v6](https://docs.gravitypdf.com/v6/users/v5-to-v6-migration).

## ⚠️BREAKING CHANGES
* New minimum requirements PHP7.3+, WordPress 5.3+, Gravity Forms 2.5+
* Removed Gravity PDF v3 template stylesheet (swap legacy PDF template to Focus Gravity template)
* Removed Gravity PDF v3 to v4 migration code (upgrade to v4/v5 before attempting v6 upgrade)
* (Dev) Moved all vendor (Packagist) packages to new `GFPDF_Vendor/` namespace (BC aliasing for common classes included). Prevents all vendor conflicts with other plugins.
* (Dev) Removed "Setup Custom Templates" tool (manually copy over template files to PDF Working Directory)
* (Dev) Removed `shortname` property from `custom_fonts` global PDF options, and removed the requirement for the `font_name` to be unique (use `id` instead of `shortname`).
* (Dev) Changed the first parameter $font_name in `GPDFAPI::delete_pdf_font()` to $font_id instead. You can no longer delete the font by
 its name, as it is no longer a unique identifier.
* (Dev) Majority of admin user interface markup (UI) changed to suit new GF2.5 UI ()
* (Dev) Renamed `\GFPDF\Helper\Fields\Field_CreditCard` class to `Field_Creditcard`
* (Dev) Change `\GFPDF\Model\Model_Install` __construct signature by removing `Helper_Abstract_Forms` dependancy from the start and adding `Model_Uninstall` at the end
* (Dev) Change `\GFPDF\Model\Model_System_Report` __construct signature by adding new `Helper_Templates` dependancy at the end
* (Dev) Removed `\GFPDF\View\View_Settings::system_status` method. Replaced by `Controller_|Model_|View_System_Report` classes for direct integration with Gravity Forms System Status page
* (Dev) Removed undocumented `gfpdf_entry_detail_pre_container_markup` and `gfpdf_entry_detail_post_container_markup` actions
* (Dev) Adjusted ID from `#tab_pdf` to `#tab_PDF` for container on Global PDF settings page. This ensures both the Global and Form PDF settings use a consistent ID.
* (Dev) Change `\GFPDF\Model\Model_Install` __construct signature by removing `Helper_Abstract_Forms` dependancy from the start and adding `Model_Uninstall` at the end
* (Dev) Change `\GFPDF\Model\Model_System_Report` __construct signature by adding new `Helper_Templates` dependancy at the end
* (Dev) Removed `\GFPDF\View\View_Settings::system_status` method. Replaced by `Controller_|Model_|View_System_Report` classes for direct integration with Gravity Forms System Status page
* (Dev) Removed undocumented `gfpdf_entry_detail_pre_container_markup` and `gfpdf_entry_detail_post_container_markup` actions
* (Dev) Adjusted ID from `#tab_pdf` to `#tab_PDF` for container on Global PDF settings page. This ensures both the Global and Form PDF settings use a consistent ID.
* (Dev) Deprecate Helper_Abstract_Options::get_font_short_name(). No direct replacement as the font 'shortname' has been phased out (using unique ID now).
* (Dev) Updated field description markup to use DIVs instead of SPANs. Matches Gravity Forms RC1
* (Dev) Deprecate these methods from `\GFPDF\Model\Model_Install`: `uninstall_plugin`, `remove_plugin_options`, `remove_plugin_form_settings`, `remove_folder_structure`, `deactivate_plugin`. All moved to `Model_Uninstall`.

## 3.1.0

## 3.0.1
* Bug - Fixed issue that caused website to become unresponsive when Gravity Forms was disabled or upgraded
* Bug - New HTML fields weren't being displayed in $form_data array
* Feature - Options for default templates to disable HTML fields or empty fields (or both)

## 3.0.0
As of Gravity PDF v3.0.0 we have removed the DOMPDF package from our plugin and integrated the more advanced mPDF system. Along with a new HTML to PDF generator, we've rewritten the entire plugin's base code to make it more user friendly to both hobbyists and rock star web developers. Configuration time is cut in half and advanced features like adding security features is now accessible to users who have little experience with PHP.

New Features include:

* Language Support - almost all languages are supported including RTL (right to left) languages like Arabic and Hebrew and CJK languages - Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
* HTML Page Numbering
* Odd and even paging with mirrored margins (most commonly used in printing).
* Nested Tables
* Text-justification and hyphenation
* Table of Contents
* Index
* Bookmarks
* Watermarks
* Password protection
* UTF-8 encoded HTML
* Better system resource handling

A new HTML to PDF package wasn't the only change to this edition of the software. We have rewritten the entire configuration system and made it super easy to get the software up and running.

Users will no longer place code in their active theme's functions.php file. Instead, configuration will happen in a new file called configuration.php, inside the PDF_EXTENDED_TEMPLATES folder (in your active theme).

Other changes include
* Improved security - further restrictions were placed on non-administrators viewing template files.
* $form_data array tidied up - images won't be wrapped in anchor tags.

For more details [view the 3.x.x online documentation](https://developer.gravitypdf.com/).

## 2.2.2

* Bug - Fixed HTML error which caused list items to distort on PDF

## 2.2.0
* Compatibility - Ensure compatibility with Gravity Forms 1.7.

Functions gform_pdf_create and gform_add_attachment have been removed and replaced with gfpdfe_create_and_attach_pdf(). See upgrade documentation for details.
* Enhancement - Added deployment code switch so the template redeployment feature can be turned on and off. This release doesn't require redeployment.
* Enhancement - PDF_Generator() variables were getting long and complex so the third variable is now an array which will pass all the optional arguments. The new 1.7 compatible functions.php code includes this method by default. For backwards compatibility the function will still work with the variable structure prior to 2.2.0.
* Bug - Fixed error generated by legacy code in the function PDF_processing() which is located in render_to_pdf.php.
* Bug - Images and stylesheets will now try and be accessed with a local path instead of a URL. It fixes problem where some hosts were preventing read access from a URL. No template changes are required.

* Feature - Product subtotal, shipping and total have been added to $form_data['field'] array to make it easier to work with product details in the custom template.
* Feature - Added two new default template files. One displays field and name in two rows (like you see when viewing an entry in the admin area) and the other removes all styling. See documentation on use.
* Security - Tightened PDF template security so that custom templates couldn't be automatically generated by just anyone. Now only logged in users with the correct privileges and the user who submitted the form (matched against IP) can auto generate a PDF. See documentation on usage.
* Deprecated - Removed form data that was added directly to the $form_data array instead of $form_data['field'] array. Users upgrading will need to update their custom templates if not using field data from the $form_data[�field'] array. If using $form_data['field'] in your custom template this won't affect you.
* Bug - Fixed problem with default template not showing and displaying a timeout error. Removed table tags and replaced with divs that are styled appropriately.
* Bug - The new plugin theme folder will successfully create when upgrading. You won't have to deactivate and reactivate to get it working.
* Bug - some installs had plugins that included the function mb_string which is also included in DOMPDF. DOMPDF will now check if the function exists before creating it.
* Bug - Remove empty signature field from the default template.
* Bug - fixed problem with redirecting to login screen even when logged in while accessing template file through the browser window directly.
* Bug - fixed error where sample template would reimport itself automatically even after deleting it. Will now only reimport if any important changes to template need to be viewed straight after an update.
* Bug - Moved render_to_pdf.php constants to pdf.php so we can use the constants in the core files. Was previously generating an error.
* Housekeeping - Cleaned up core template files, moved functions into classes and added more in-file documentation.
* Housekeeping - moved install/upgrade code from pdf.php to installation-update-manager.php
* Housekeeping - changed pdf-entry-detail.php class name from GFEntryDetail to GFPDFEntryDetail to remove compatibility problems with Gravity Forms.
* Housekeeping - created pdf-settings.php file to house the settings page code.
